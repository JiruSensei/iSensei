    documentation="The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell can process data sequentially and keep its hidden state through time.&#xA;Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture[1] used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections that make it a &quot;general purpose computer&quot; (that is, it can compute anything that a Turing machine can).[2] It can not only process single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition[3] or speech recognition.[4][5] Bloomberg Business Week wrote: &quot;These powers make LSTM arguably the most commercial AI achievement, used for everything from predicting diseases to composing music.&quot;[6]&#xA;&#xA;A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.&#xA;&#xA;LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the exploding and vanishing gradient problems that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications">
