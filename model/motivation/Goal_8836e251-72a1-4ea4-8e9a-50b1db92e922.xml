    documentation=" It should be possible to build a model without embedding hardware-specific information in it, and get &quot;good&quot; performance out of the hardware. We should provide the (opt-in) ability to further tune the model for specific accelerators to achieve full peak performance, and make sure that is a low-friction path that doesnâ€™t require a rewrite of a model."/>
